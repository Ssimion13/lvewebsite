                <p className="serviceDescriptionText">
                    Capsule endoscopy is an outpatient procedure that involves visualization 
                    of the small intestine with the use of a wireless capsule equipped with a 
                    tiny camera that takes thousands of pictures for later evaluation by the 
                    gastroenterologist. The procedure, which typically takes approximately 8 hours,
                    is able to detect abnormalities in the small bowel that the conventional 
                    endoscope and colonoscope is unable to reach.
