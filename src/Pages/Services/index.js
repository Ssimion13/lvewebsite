                        An upper endoscopy, also referred to as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 
                        or EGD, is a painless examination of the esophagus, stomach and the 
                        first portion of the small intestine or the duodenum. This is done 
                        with an endoscope, a thin, flexible tube with a camera at the end. 
                        Tissue samples, referred to as biopsies, may be taken during the procedure 
                        to check for inflammation, changes in the lining of the esophagus, 
                        stomach and duodenum, and to determine the presence of the bacteria, 
                        Helicobacter pylori, which can cause gastric cancer.
